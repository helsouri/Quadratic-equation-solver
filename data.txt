Please enter the value of a: 1.00
Please enter the value of b: -4.00
Please enter the value of c: 4.00
The value of the discriminant is: 0.00

Therefore we have one real repeated root x1 = x2 = 2.00 and our factor is x1 + -2.00 

The factor is [ x - (2.00) ][ x - (2.00) ]

Please enter the value of a: 1.00
Please enter the value of b: 0.00
Please enter the value of c: -4.00
The value of the discriminant is: 16.00

Therefore we have two real unique solutions which are x1= -2.00 and x2 = 2.00
The factors are [x - (-2.00)][x -(2.00)]

Please enter the value of a: 1.00
Please enter the value of b: -4.00
Please enter the value of c: 5.00
The value of the discriminant is: -4.00

Therefore we have two unique complex solutions which are x1= 2.00 + 2.00i and x2 = 2.00 - 2.00i

The factors are [x - (2.00 + 2.00i)][x -  (2.00 - 2.00i)]
